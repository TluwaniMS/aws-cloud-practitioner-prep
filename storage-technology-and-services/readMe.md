# Storage Technology and Services

## AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Amazon Elastic Block Store is a block storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to create persistent block storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances.
EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be used as primary storage for data-intensive workloads such as databases, file systems, and application hosting. 

## AWS EFS (Elastic File System)

AWS EFS is a scalable, fully managed file storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Unlike Amazon EBS, which provides block storage, Amazon EFS provides file storage, making it suitable for use cases that require shared access to files between multiple Amazon EC2 instances or other AWS services.

## AWS Instance Store

AWS Instance Store,is a type of temporary block storage provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Amazon EC2 instances. Instance store volumes are physically attached to the host server that hosts the EC2 instance and provide temporary block-level storage that persists only for the duration of the instance's life cycle. Once the instance is terminated, the data stored on the instance store volumes is lost.

## AWS S3(Simple Storage Service)

S3 is commonly used for a wide range of use cases, including data storage for websites, application data, backup and recovery, big data analytics, content distribution, and archiving.
