# Migration and Transfer Technology and Services

## The AWS Snow Family

The AWS Snow family is a set of physical devices offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help customers transfer large amounts of data to and from the AWS cloud securely and efficiently, particularly when network transfer may not be feasible due to bandwidth limitations, security concerns, or other constraints.

* #### AWS Snowcone

It is a small, rugged, and portable device designed for edge computing, IoT, and disconnected environments. Snowcone is about the size of a large toaster and can withstand harsh conditions. It's particularly useful for collecting, processing, and transferring data in remote locations.

* #### AWS Snowball

Snowball is a larger device designed for transporting petabytes of data to AWS. It comes in two options: the original Snowball and Snowball Edge. The Snowball can store up to 80 terabytes of data, while the Snowball Edge offers more storage capacity (up to 100 TB) and also includes computing capabilities for edge computing applications.AWS Snowmobile

* #### Snowmobile

 is a massive, ruggedized shipping container pulled by a semi-trailer truck. It is designed for customers who need to transfer exabytes of data to AWS. Snowmobile can hold up to 100 petabytes of data, making it suitable for large-scale data migration projects.

## The AWS Transfer Family

The AWS Transfer Family refers to a set of services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for securely transferring files to and from AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS (Elastic File System).

* #### AWS Transfer for SFTP (Simple File Transfer Protocol)

This service allows you to set up SFTP servers in AWS without managing underlying infrastructure. It enables you to securely transfer files over SSH (Secure Shell) directly into and out of Amazon S3 buckets.

* #### AWS Transfer for FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Similar to AWS Transfer for SFTP, this service allows you to set up FTP servers in AWS without managing servers. It provides support for FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) and FTP, allowing you to transfer files securely into and out of Amazon S3.

## AWS Datasync

AWS DataSync is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that facilitates the transfer of large amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services, such as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Amazon EFS (Elastic File System). It is designed to simplify and accelerate the process of migrating data to the cloud, synchronizing data between on-premises and cloud storage, and transferring data for data processing and analysis in the cloud.

## AWS Application Discovery Service

AWS Application Discovery Service is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps customers plan their migration to the AWS cloud by collecting and analyzing information about their on-premises data center infrastructure and application dependencies.

## AWS Migration Hub

AWS Migration Hub is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps organizations plan and track the migration of their applications and workloads to the AWS cloud. It provides a centralized location to manage the migration process, track the progress of migration projects, and access key resources and tools for migration.

## AWS Application Migration Service

AWS Migration Service (MGN), known as the AWS Application Migration Service, offers an extensively automated lift-and-shift (rehosting) approach, streamlining, accelerating, and cost-saving the process of migrating applications to AWS. It enables businesses to transfer a substantial array of physical, virtual, or cloud servers seamlessly, eliminating compatibility concerns, minimizing performance interruptions, and shortening the cutover periods.
