# AWS Cloud Practitioner Prep

# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the convenient access and utilization of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking tools, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (commonly known as "the cloud"), eliminating the need for direct user management.

# Cloud Computing Service Models.

## Platform As a Service (PaaS):

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service model providing a versatile and scalable platform for app development, deployment, operation, and management. It simplifies the process by eliminating the need to handle the usual complexities involved in building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure for applications.

## Infrastructure As a Service (IaaS):

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a model within cloud computing that delivers internet-accessible, on-demand IT infrastructure encompassing computing power, storage, and networking resources.

## Software As a Service (Saas):

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a facet of cloud computing where applications are provided over the Internet, functioning as services.

# The benefits of cloud computing:

* ### High Availability:

High availability in cloud computing refers to the ability of a system or service to remain operational and accessible for users for a significant portion of time, typically 99.9% or higher. This is achieved through redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms implemented within the cloud infrastructure.

* ### Elasticity:

 In cloud computing, elasticity refers to the ability of a system to dynamically adjust its resources (such as computing power, storage, or bandwidth) based on demand. It's akin to a rubber band that can stretch or contract as needed.

* ### Durability:

In cloud computing, durability refers to the ability of data to remain intact and accessible over time, despite potential hardware failures, software errors, or other disruptions.

* ### Agility:

In cloud computing, agility refers to the ability to quickly and efficiently adapt to changing demands and requirements. This includes the ability to rapidly provision and scale resources up or down as needed, automate processes to streamline operations, and deploy new applications or services swiftly. Essentially, agility in cloud computing enables organizations to be more responsive, flexible, and efficient in utilizing cloud resources to meet their business objectives.
